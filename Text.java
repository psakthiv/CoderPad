### Org Mission:
VOCAL (Voice of Carers Across Lothian) is an organisation committed to the wellbeing and support of carers throughout Midlothian and Edinburgh. It functions as an advocacy organisation, a provider of comprehensive carer support, and a social enterprise. Through its two carer hubs and various locality bases across the region, VOCAL delivers a wide range of both digital and in-person services.

These services encompass the creation of Adult Carer Support and Emergency Plans, and offering detailed guidance on carers' rights and entitlements. VOCAL also provides a robust program of events and activities designed to engage and support carers in their roles. Emotional support, counselling, and wellbeing services are core to their offerings, as are resources addressing welfare rights, financial matters, and legal issues.

In addition, VOCAL facilitates short breaks for carers, giving them much-needed respite, and provides support to employers and those working closely with carers. For families dealing with addiction, whether related to drugs or alcohol, VOCAL offers targeted family support services. Furthermore, the organisation operates Treasure Tree, a social enterprise aimed at enhancing the economic wellbeing of unpaid carers and their families, underscoring its commitment to improving the lives of carers in multiple dimensions.

### What Are We Trying to Achieve?
One of VOCAL's key initiatives is to provide grants that allow carers to take breaks, helping to improve their overall wellbeing. These grants, which do not need to be repaid, can be used in various ways to enhance self-care, reduce social isolation, or encourage hobbies and interests—anything that gives carers a needed respite.

Currently, the process to apply for these grants involves filling out an online form that interacts with VOCAL’s case management system (CSM). However, the process is burdened with several manual steps: after a carer submits a form, a VOCAL team member must download and manually enter the data into the CSM, as there is no direct integration between the form and the system. Additionally, the current form has limitations in terms of accessibility and integration with the CSM API.

### The Solution
The proposed solution is to develop a new form that addresses these issues. This form will be designed to integrate seamlessly with VOCAL’s case management system, improving efficiency by eliminating manual data entry and enhancing accessibility for users.

### Tech Used
We are currently evaluating various WordPress plugins to create the new form with the necessary capabilities. Our team has analyzed multiple plugins, comparing them on factors such as integration potential, accessibility features, and ease of use. We are in discussions with our clients to finalize the most suitable option.

### Long-Term Systemic Change
The new, integrated form will lead to significant long-term improvements in VOCAL’s operations. By streamlining the grant application process, the organisation will be able to process applications more efficiently and reduce the administrative burden on staff. This, in turn, will allow VOCAL to support more carers more effectively, contributing to the overall mission of improving the wellbeing of carers in the community.

### How Does It Make Them More Effective?
This solution will make VOCAL more effective by automating manual processes, reducing the potential for human error, and enhancing the user experience for carers applying for grants. It will also free up staff time, allowing them to focus on more critical aspects of carer support and advocacy.

### Learnings
One of the key learnings from this project was the importance of scope finalization. Initially, we had extensive discussions with our clients in March and agreed upon a project scope. However, as the project progressed, we had to revise the scope due to differing expectations from both parties. This experience underscored the need for clear communication and thorough alignment on project goals before starting development.
