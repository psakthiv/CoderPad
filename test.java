Certainly! Here's a refined version of your statement with added points to enhance your appeal for the public speaking program:

As a Java developer on the iSearch Team, my daily activities revolve around coding and defect resolution, which I find immensely fulfilling. Recently, I completed my master's in Data Science from the University of Glasgow, an achievement that has significantly broadened my analytical and technical skills. Additionally, I successfully completed the Ben Nevis trek in 9 hours, a testament to my determination and resilience. For the past 8 months, I have been a consistent yoga practitioner, which has greatly improved my focus and mental clarity.

During my undergraduate studies, I actively participated in numerous paper presentations. These experiences significantly boosted my confidence and ignited my passion for public speaking. In my previous organization, I presented various design ideas within my line of business, further honing my presentation skills, though I did not have many opportunities for broader public speaking engagements.

I am eager to enhance my public speaking abilities further. Joining this program would provide me with the structured guidance and practice I need to refine my skills. My technical background and diverse experiences uniquely position me to bring a fresh perspective to discussions, making me an asset to the program. I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to learn from seasoned speakers and peers, and to contribute my own insights and experiences.

In addition to my technical expertise and achievements, my ability to convey complex ideas clearly and engagingly is something I am continually working to improve. I believe that effective communication is a key component of professional success and I am committed to mastering this skill. I am confident that this program will help me achieve this goal and I am excited about the possibility of contributing to and learning from the community.
